# auto_industry_recalls_stock_prediction
Data Science Challenge for the prediction on product recalls' impact on the auto-industry's main players.
# Introduction

The objective of this challenge is to predict the impact of a product recall on a company's stock price, more precisely we study said impact on the biggest automobile groups. A product recall is a procedure launched by a company to get back a product sold to consumers because it is suscpected to have a defect. 

The correlation between a product recall and a company's share value has been demonstrated by empirical studies (see the article <ins>Automotive Recalls and Informational Efficiency</ins> fom *Hoffer, Pruitt & Reillt* in 1987 on the Financial Review). Thus, the impact will be measured through the company's stock price depreciation.

We will use data coming from 3 sources : 

* The Vehicle Safety Branch Recalls Database from UK government to get data on automobile recalls (https://data.gov.uk/dataset/18c00cf3-3bb2-4930-b30d-78113113aaa7/vehicle-safety-branch-recalls-database)

* Yahoo! Finance to get stock price data (https://fr.finance.yahoo.com)

* Finally, we will use data from ADEME (French environment agency) that give will give us some information about the vehicles (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/emissions-de-co2-et-de-polluants-des-vehicules-commercialises-en-france/#_)
